Here’s a breakdown of **how to identify each coding pattern** and **when to consider using it**. I’ve added comments for each pattern to help you recognize the problem type and decide when to apply the pattern:

---

### 1. **Sliding Window**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves arrays, strings, or sequences.
     - You need to find a subarray or substring that meets a specific condition (e.g., maximum sum, longest substring with unique characters).
     - The problem has a fixed window size or a condition that can be satisfied by adjusting the window size.
   - **Example**: "Find the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`."

### 2. **Two Pointers**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves a sorted array or linked list.
     - You need to find pairs, triplets, or manipulate elements in place.
     - The problem requires comparing or processing elements from both ends or at different speeds.
   - **Example**: "Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target sum."

### 3. **Fast & Slow Pointers**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves linked lists or arrays with cycles.
     - You need to detect cycles, find the middle of a list, or solve problems involving circular structures.
   - **Example**: "Detect if a linked list has a cycle."

### 4. **Merge Intervals**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves intervals or ranges.
     - You need to merge overlapping intervals, find conflicting intervals, or insert new intervals.
   - **Example**: "Merge all overlapping intervals in a list."

### 5. **Cyclic Sort**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves an array containing numbers in a given range (e.g., 1 to `n`).
     - You need to sort the array in place or find missing/duplicate numbers.
   - **Example**: "Find the smallest missing positive number in an unsorted array."

### 6. **In-place Linked List Reversal**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves reversing a linked list or part of it.
     - You need to manipulate the linked list in place without using extra space.
   - **Example**: "Reverse a linked list in place."

### 7. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves traversing trees or graphs level by level.
     - You need to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph or explore all nodes at a given depth.
   - **Example**: "Find the shortest path in a maze."

### 8. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves traversing trees or graphs, exploring as far as possible before backtracking.
     - You need to find connected components, paths, or solve problems involving recursion.
   - **Example**: "Find all paths in a binary tree that sum to a target value."

### 9. **Heaps (Priority Queue)**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves finding the smallest/largest elements or maintaining a dynamic ordering.
     - You need to efficiently manage a collection of elements with priority.
   - **Example**: "Find the top `k` frequent elements in an array."

---

### 10. **Subsets & Combinations**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves generating all possible subsets, combinations, or permutations.
     - You need to explore all possible solutions, often using recursion.
   - **Example**: "Generate all subsets of a set."

---

### 11. **Modified Binary Search**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves searching in a sorted array or finding the boundary of a condition.
     - The problem requires efficient searching with a time complexity of O(log n).
   - **Example**: "Find the first occurrence of a target in a sorted array."

---

### 12. **Topological Sort**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with dependencies.
     - You need to find a linear ordering of vertices where each vertex comes before its dependencies.
   - **Example**: "Schedule tasks with dependencies."

---

### 13. **Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves optimization with constraints (e.g., selecting items with maximum value without exceeding a limit).
     - The problem can be broken into overlapping subproblems.
   - **Example**: "Solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem."

---

### 14. **Backtracking**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves exploring all possible solutions, often with recursion.
     - You need to generate permutations, combinations, or solve constraint satisfaction problems.
   - **Example**: "Solve the N-Queens problem."

---

### 15. **Bit Manipulation**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves binary operations or requires working with bits.
     - You need to count set bits, find unique numbers, or perform efficient bitwise operations.
   - **Example**: "Find the single number in an array where all other numbers appear twice."

---

### 16. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves grouping elements into disjoint sets.
     - You need to efficiently perform union and find operations.
   - **Example**: "Detect cycles in an undirected graph."

### 17. **Dynamic Programming (Memoization/Tabulation)**
   - **When to Consider**:
     - The problem involves overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
     - You need to break the problem into smaller subproblems and store their results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Example**: "Find the longest increasing subsequence in an array."
